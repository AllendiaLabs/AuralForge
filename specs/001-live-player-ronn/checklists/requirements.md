# Specification Quality Checklist: The Live Player (Phase 1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 16 items passed on initial validation and remain passing after clarification session (2026-08-19).
- Clarification session corrected the plugin mode from synthesizer to audio effect, added activation function selection, defined parameter ranges, established model-agnostic naming, and clarified channel configuration as user-defined.
- Assumptions section documents platform scope (macOS first), node graph being read-only in Phase 1, and audio effect as the primary mode.
